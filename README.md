# Milestone Project 1
This is a photographer website. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices. 
My client and I had discussed thoroughly about the look  and the purpose of the website, so I designed with the thought of having a simple and eye-catching webpage. The aim of the project is to show his works and find clients.
## Design
- Colour Scheme : The main colour used are black, white and grey. My client takes black&white pictute so I decided to follow his style.
- Typography : The main font used is Arial for the whole website with Helvetica and san-serif as a fallback font in case the main font is not imported into the site correctly.
- Imagery : Together with my client we chose a picture for the background's home page. We find it attractive on his semplicity.
